# Meeting Minutes

### Meeting notes (Feb 8):
- decided on parkinson & columbia datasets to make a model for predicting the relationship between farm land and microbiome indicators.
- for Thursday, February 15
-   See if there's enough samples with NO PARKINSON & YES FARM
-   Paired end vs single end?

### Meeting (Thursday, February 15):
- some things that we might want to do as intermediate steps in our project (unless other papers already did it in which case we can just cite their data): 
- check whether the beta diversity between farm and non-farm people is significantly different
- possibly check alpha diversity of the farm people
- indicator species analuysis for the farm people
- for validating: species present in farm population, and the relative abundance of these species
Presence/absence, and abundance

To do for the next meeting (Thursday, Febraury 29):
- SEND TABLE.QZV FILES (before rarefaction) and the rarefaction curve with a proposed number for sampling depth (completed)
- make phyloseq object for Colombia (don't need to rarefy)
- pull out non-pd and remove NAs
    - to filter phyloseq object: look at modules, and find the "subset...."
- ALL diversity metrics (alpha and beta) PD dataset (completed)
    - alpha: richness, faiths, shannon, ....
    - beta: bray curtis, jaccard, .... 
    - include figures
- run significance on everything (categorical variables??)
- put figures on github
- pool each city into each cohort so we don't check model for each person to person, rather looking at presence/absence and abundance for each city.
- organize Github (dates, progress made)

### Meeting (Thursday, February 22)
- ran a- and b-diversity metrics on the filtered PD dataset (from now on, the Farm dataset)
    - the generate PCoA plots show clustering of groups for different b-diversity measures
- to test for significant differences in b-diversity measures, which test to use
    - correlation?
    - 2-tailed t-test?

Keegan Notes Feb 22:
- Covered that our diversity metrics weren't ideal. Continue the proposal without this in mind.
- Possible options: 
    - Subset by gender and look for male:CHAO1
    - Build rare species model?
    - Pi-crust 2 functional model (predicted metabolic pathways)
    - Switch initial dataset
- Discussed other possible datasets we could switch to for improved diversity. > if found send to Evelyn
- Rarefication only needed before diversity metrics. Do not rarefy for other analysis
- We are no longer doing logistic regression model -> just taxonomic modeling comparing indicator list to taxa analysis

Keegan Notes - Feb 29 2024
- Core Microbiome Analysis Discussions
    - Too little ASVs? Thresholds maybe too stringent? 
    - Re-ran: Set Detection at 0 and prevalence at 0.1 - More promising numbers Farm: 47 No Farm: 16, shared: 264
- Indicator Taxa
    - Got a few which is good, pvalue show signficance. Stat number is 0.3 = not great inficator species
    - Make it so all 6 found indicator species need to be present for our model?
    - Fill in Taxa table -> fill in genus and keep species as ASVs.
    - Re-ran: Glommed at species level - 21 indicators. Highest 0.4.
- Still should pool by city
    - Taxonomic analysis to look for them
    - Relative abundance

-To do:
Table to reconsile overlapping new indicator species and core 47 Farm data. 
    - Filter out/BLAST then with highest threshold stats (10-15 species) for next meeting.
Next meeting - present what our table is -> figure out what we can do with Colombia dataset. 
Leo - Create 5 new phyloseq objects - each one in for different cities. 

Decide between 2 below:
2 approaches -> 
    - can do research paper (but poor model) lots of limitations to apply cross-country analysis OR 
    - write methods paper (more technical) pipeline how to create models using our dataset as only an example
        - Will change expectations compared to rest of class for final manuscript.
        - Novelty is how we apply the model 

March 7:
Only 3 species in common between the ISA and ASVs in the exposed group
12 indicator species identified when setting IV>0.2 and p<0.05 (all blasted, see ISA_BLAST table in Code/parkinsons)
    - IV threshold selected arbitrarily
