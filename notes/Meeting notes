# Meeting Minutes

### Meeting notes (Feb 8):
- decided on parkinson & columbia datasets to make a model for predicting the relationship between farm land and microbiome indicators.
- for Thursday, February 15
-   See if there's enough samples with NO PARKINSON & YES FARM
-   Paired end vs single end?

### Meeting (Thursday, February 15):
- some things that we might want to do as intermediate steps in our project (unless other papers already did it in which case we can just cite their data): 
- check whether the beta diversity between farm and non-farm people is significantly different
- possibly check alpha diversity of the farm people
- indicator species analuysis for the farm people
- for validating: species present in farm population, and the relative abundance of these species
Presence/absence, and abundance

To do for the next meeting (Thursday, Febraury 29):
- SEND TABLE.QZV FILES (before rarefaction) and the rarefaction curve with a proposed number for sampling depth (completed)
- make phyloseq object for Colombia (don't need to rarefy)
- pull out non-pd and remove NAs
    - to filter phyloseq object: look at modules, and find the "subset...."
- ALL diversity metrics (alpha and beta) PD dataset (completed)
    - alpha: richness, faiths, shannon, ....
    - beta: bray curtis, jaccard, .... 
    - include figures
- run significance on everything (categorical variables??)
- put figures on github
- pool each city into each cohort so we don't check model for each person to person, rather looking at presence/absence and abundance for each city.
- organize Github (dates, progress made)

### Meeting (Thursday, February 22)
- ran a- and b-diversity metrics on the filtered PD dataset (from now on, the Farm dataset)
    - the generate PCoA plots show clustering of groups for different b-diversity measures
- to test for significant differences in b-diversity measures, which test to use
    - correlation?
    - 2-tailed t-test?

Keegan Notes Feb 22:
- Covered that our diversity metrics weren't ideal. Continue the proposal without this in mind.
- Possible options: 
    - Subset by gender and look for male:CHAO1
    - Build rare species model?
    - Pi-crust 2 functional model (predicted metabolic pathways)
    - Switch initial dataset
- Discussed other possible datasets we could switch to for improved diversity. > if found send to Evelyn
- Rarefication only needed before diversity metrics. Do not rarefy for other analysis
- We are no longer doing logistic regression model -> just taxonomic modeling comparing indicator list to taxa analysis

Keegan Notes - Feb 29 2024
- Core Microbiome Analysis Discussions
    - Too little ASVs? Thresholds maybe too stringent? 
    - Re-ran: Set Detection at 0 and prevalence at 0.1 - More promising numbers Farm: 47 No Farm: 16, shared: 264
- Indicator Taxa
    - Got a few which is good, pvalue show signficance. Stat number is 0.3 = not great inficator species
    - Make it so all 6 found indicator species need to be present for our model?
    - Fill in Taxa table -> fill in genus and keep species as ASVs.
    - Re-ran: Glommed at species level - 21 indicators. Highest 0.4.
- Still should pool by city
    - Taxonomic analysis to look for them
    - Relative abundance

-To do:
Table to reconsile overlapping new indicator species and core 47 Farm data. 
    - Filter out/BLAST then with highest threshold stats (10-15 species) for next meeting.
Next meeting - present what our table is -> figure out what we can do with Colombia dataset. 
Leo - Create 5 new phyloseq objects - each one in for different cities. 

Decide between 2 below:
2 approaches -> 
    - can do research paper (but poor model) lots of limitations to apply cross-country analysis OR 
    - write methods paper (more technical) pipeline how to create models using our dataset as only an example
        - Will change expectations compared to rest of class for final manuscript.
        - Novelty is how we apply the model 

March 7:
Only 3 species in common between the ISA and ASVs in the exposed group
12 indicator species identified when setting IV>0.2 and p<0.05 (all blasted, see ISA_BLAST table in Code/parkinsons)
    - IV threshold selected arbitrarily
- how to interpret the bar plots generated in core microbiome analysis? --> use differential abudance plots using relative abudance
        - phylum level, facet by y/n
        - only meaningful if there are clear patterns
        - group samples by y/n
- how to interpret and describe IV values? what are "plots"?
    - IV = 1 = perfect indicator
    - anything less than that is a worse predictor
    - 0.7 is an arbitrary number to trim down the amount of indicator species

Keegan Notes - March 7 2024

- Evelyn Strongly leans towards methods paper
    - Introduce protocol/pipeline and show someone how we can apply this model. 
    - We should still apply to colombia dataset to demonstrate method
    - Limitation being the dataset
- Comparison to Colombia data
    - Create list in form of dictionary (In python, find R equivalent) > Use for loop to find if exists
    - Boxplot of absolute abundance of species - have other included
- Methods paper: Designing Taxonomic model
    - Intro is why methodology is important - makes our team proposal secondary
    - Protocols
    - Methods: Theory behind what is tax model, how it was build, explained as if someone was going through
        - Reference Script in Github
    - Discussions/Future Applications/Comparison to other modelling/Ideal datasets
        - Should be able to assess with other farm datasets
- Proposal discussion
    - Writing: No cohesiveness - choppiness - scattered ideas, not enough group editing
    - Intro should have signficance - why are we looking
    - Objectives: lot of repetition
    - Workflow: Not great understanding of general workflow? - 
    - Approach table: lacking specificity & generic. I.e parkinson's filtering etc, Qiime workflow
    - Edits to make:
        - Extension can be offered: By Friday next week. 
        - 6.5 points offered if we address feedback - bump mark up to 50
- Relative abundance - 2 bars -> yes/no for phylum level - instead of taxa bar plot. 
- Indicator values for species -> all significant but in theory how good indicates condition.
- Model application not validate data
- Leo's tiered model -> do not combine ISA and Core microbiome? Good idea -> show what data shows first.
    - Using scoring system to predict farm vs non-farm > Maybe can do research paper

Data is the data :)

To do:
- Start to write comparison code to apply our indicator ASVs to colombia dataset
- Table of cities and which ones we predict will come (more) positive and negative


Meeting: March 14
Agenda:
- summarize and discuss filtering of the identified model species in city-subsetted phyloseq objects
- discuss predicting ranking of cities for agricultural exposure
- revision of the introduction for team proposal?

Keegan Notes - March 14 2024

Discussion of results from last week
- Have proven concept model now -> just nothing much to test the model with
- Possibly new dataset -> more farmer detailed dataset
    - stool samples
    - look for 16s amplicon seq 
    - data availability section: publicly published data
    - although if cannot validate/confirm -> then model doesn't work 

Methods paper route
- Evelyn will build a new rubric for us
- Have a limitations/future directions discussing ideal datasets > discuss later about combining sections or separate
- Characteristics of what a good dataset should be? Controls and other test guidelines for the model

Meeting to plan for overview for our paper and presentations: March 28th

Asked Evenlyn about our significance paragraph and our edited proposal title.
- Keep everything in writing directly realted to what we are doing.
- Highlight prior knowledge and show how that should be predicting our model/project

Actions:
- List of farm data send to evelyn for new detailed farm processing
- Finish analyses by end of this month > presentations and manuscript starting April
- Send in revised proposal by Friday

Keegan  Notes - March 21 2024

Sent 5 dataset options - One was good
Ekaterina tried importing but had issues: - Need to use our farm specific manifest
Did some troubleshooting for importing farm data > Worked!

Methods paper shouldn't be much about farming -> Focus mainly on the model

To Do:
Have everything (farm dataset > phyloseq > for loop > Visualize) done by next week
Then set up a powerpoint that combines all our data

Meeting: March 28 2024

Figure 1: alpha diversity (3 panels)
Beta diversity to supplemental (e.g. PCoA plots)
Figure 2: core microbiome (the less strngent one with more ASVs)
Table 1: comprehensive indicator taxa (the one with all of them, 17-19)
Table 2: taxonomic model (the 3 taxa)
Figure 3: bubble plot (get code from team 12)

To Do:
for the code: filter (subset taxa) the phyloseq object by order > family > genus (not species)
prepare powerpoint for presentation
