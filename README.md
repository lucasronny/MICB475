# MICB475-Group-11
MICB 475 project

Meeting notes Feb 8:
  Decided on parkinson & columbia datasets to make a model for predicting the relationship between farm land and microbiome indicators.

For Thursday 15
  See if there's enough samples with NO PARKINSON & YES FARM
  Paired end vs single end?

  PARKINSONS:
  Should I have filtered the mitochondria + chlorplast?

  Was 251 a good cutoff for filtering (i.e the last base pair, ~25 quality score)?
    
  All the "NO DISEASE & FARM=YES" have 0 in constipation?
    
  Help with rarefaction curve - should we cut 1 of the samples off? 
    
  25 samples with YES-farm, NO-PD
    
  what now???
