# MICB475-Group-11: Project 2

### Processing of the Parkinson's dataset in QIIME2 (INSERT DATE HERE):

Results:
- 25 samples with YES-farm, NO-PD

To inquire in meeting: 
- Should I have filtered the mitochondria + chlorplast?
- Was 251 a good cutoff for filtering (i.e the last base pair, ~25 quality score)? 
- All the "NO DISEASE & FARM=YES" have 0 in constipation?
- Help with rarefaction curve - should we cut 1 of the samples off?
- Further steps?


- organize Github (dates, progress made)
