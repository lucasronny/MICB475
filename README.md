# MICB475-Group-11
MICB 475 project

Meeting notes Feb 8:
  Decided on parkinson & columbia datasets to make a model for predicting the relationship between farm land and microbiome indicators.

For Thursday 15
  See if there's enough samples with NO PARKINSON & YES FARM
  Paired end vs single end?

  PARKINSONS:
  Should I have filtered the mitochondria + chlorplast?

  Was 251 a good cutoff for filtering (i.e the last base pair, ~25 quality score)?
    
  All the "NO DISEASE & FARM=YES" have 0 in constipation?
    
  Help with rarefaction curve - should we cut 1 of the samples off? 
    
  25 samples with YES-farm, NO-PD
    
  what now???

some things that we might want to do as intermediate steps in our project (unless other papers already did it in which case we can just cite their data): 

-check whether the beta diversity between farm and non-farm people is significantly different

-possibly check alpha diversity of the farm people

-indicator species analuysis for the farm people
