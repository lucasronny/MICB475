pull out non-pd and remove NAs

for validating: species present in farm population, and the relative abundance of these species
Presence/absence, and abundance

ALL diversity metrics (alpha and beta) for the 


Send table.qzv and alpha rarefaction curve
optimize cutoff alpha rarefaction from the table.qzv file on qiime visualizer

alpha:
richness
faiths 
shannon

Beta:
bray curtis
jay 


### Meeting (Thursday, February 15):
- some things that we might want to do as intermediate steps in our project (unless other papers already did it in which case we can just cite their data): 
- check whether the beta diversity between farm and non-farm people is significantly different
- possibly check alpha diversity of the farm people
- indicator species analuysis for the farm people

To do for the next meeting (Thursday, Febraury 29):
- SEND TABLE.QZV FILES (before rarefaction)
- make phyloseq object for Colombia (don't need to rarefy)

- alpha (Faith's, Shannon's) and beta (Bray Curtis, Jaccard) diversity and include figures (can post figure on Github)

- organize Github (dates, progress made)

run significance on everything

put figures on github

to filter phyloseq object: look at modules, and find the "subset...."

pool each city into each cohort so we don't check model for each person to person, rather looking at presence/absence and abundance for each city.
