# Meeting Minutes

### Meeting notes (Feb 8):
- decided on parkinson & columbia datasets to make a model for predicting the relationship between farm land and microbiome indicators.
- for Thursday, February 15
-   See if there's enough samples with NO PARKINSON & YES FARM
-   Paired end vs single end?

### Meeting (Thursday, February 15):
- some things that we might want to do as intermediate steps in our project (unless other papers already did it in which case we can just cite their data): 
- check whether the beta diversity between farm and non-farm people is significantly different
- possibly check alpha diversity of the farm people
- indicator species analuysis for the farm people
- for validating: species present in farm population, and the relative abundance of these species
Presence/absence, and abundance

To do for the next meeting (Thursday, Febraury 29):
- SEND TABLE.QZV FILES (before rarefaction) and the rarefaction curve with a proposed number for sampling depth
- make phyloseq object for Colombia (don't need to rarefy)
- pull out non-pd and remove NAs
    - to filter phyloseq object: look at modules, and find the "subset...."
- ALL diversity metrics (alpha and beta) PD dataset
    - alpha: richness, faiths, shannon
    - beta: bray curtis, jaccard
    - include figures
- run significance on everything
- put figures on github
- pool each city into each cohort so we don't check model for each person to person, rather looking at presence/absence and abundance for each city.
- organize Github (dates, progress made)
